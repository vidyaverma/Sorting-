QUICKSORT

QuickSort works on the principle of divide and conquer,that finds a pivot element such that all elements to the left of it is smaller than pivot whereas element to the right are all greater than pivot.
The same is applied in to further subproblems.
Time Complexity:
Worse Case: O(n^2)
Average and best case: O(nlogn)
